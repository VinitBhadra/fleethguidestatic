### Platform 5: QUORA

#### Strategy: Answer Questions & Link to Your Tools

**Find Questions:**
```
Search on Quora:
- "fleet management calculator"
- "fuel cost calculator"
- "GPS tracking India"
- "truck expenses"
- "transport business India"
- "commercial vehicle costs"
```

**Answer Template:**

**Question:** "How do I calculate fuel costs for my truck?"

**Your Answer:**
```
I calculate fuel costs for my fleet using this simple formula:

Fuel Cost = (Distance ÷ Vehicle Mileage) × Fuel Price

For example:
- Distance: 500 km
- Mileage: 12 km/L
- Fuel price: ₹102.50/L

Calculation:
(500 ÷ 12) × 102.50 = ₹4,270.83

To make this easier, I built a free calculator that does this instantly: [FleetGuide.in](https://fleetguide.in)

Just enter your distance, fuel price, and mileage - you get the cost immediately. Works great for trip planning and client quotes.

It also has 17 other calculators for fleet management (distance, speed, route planning, etc.) - all free and mobile-friendly.

Hope this helps!
